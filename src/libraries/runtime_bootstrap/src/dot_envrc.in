# Description:  dot_envrc.in
#
#               This file, 'dot_envrc.in', implements a basic
#               template for creation of '.envrc' file in the root
#               of the OUTPUT artifacts mount-point.
#
#               It functions as an environment provisioning script
#               for running the Machinekit-HAL framework from
#               CMake build BINARY tree.
#
#               This file should be used via the direnv program. But
#               can be aslo sourced as is. More info at https://direnv.net/
